# ChangeFlow Development Progress

## Current Session: 2025-08-20

### Today's Work Summary
- ✅ **FIXED ECO Kanban Board Issues**: Resolved ECO drag and drop problems
- ✅ Improved status mapping consistency between UI columns and database
- ✅ Added better error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Server running at http://localhost:3000

### Issues Fixed Today
1. **Status Mapping Inconsistency**: 
   - Problem: `BACKLOG` column mapped to `DRAFT` status, but multiple statuses showed in `BACKLOG`
   - Solution: Improved mapping to preserve original status when moving within same logical group
   
2. **Error Handling**: 
   - Added user alerts for failed status updates
   - Added success logging for debugging
   - Maintained optimistic UI updates with proper rollback

### Technical Details Fixed
- **File**: `app/dashboard/eco/page.tsx`
- **Functions Modified**:
  - `mapStatusToColumn()`: Added `APPROVED` to `BACKLOG` column, `CANCELLED` to `COMPLETED`
  - `mapColumnToEcoStatus()`: Now preserves original status when appropriate
  - Enhanced error handling in `handleDragEnd()`

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Dashboard routing structure
- [x] ECR workflow implementation  
- [x] Authentication system with NextAuth
- [x] Basic ECO and ECR CRUD operations
- [x] **ECO kanban board drag and drop functionality**
- [x] **ECO status update consistency**
- [x] **Error handling and user feedback**

### Technical Notes
- ECR = Engineering Change Request
- ECO = Engineering Change Order  
- Using NextAuth for authentication
- **Kanban board now working correctly with proper status mapping**
- API endpoint `/api/eco/[id]` PATCH method confirmed working
- Using @dnd-kit for drag and drop functionality

### Issues Fixed Today (Continued)
3. **ECR Creation Foreign Key Error**:
   - Problem: Users couldn't create ECRs due to `organizationId` foreign key constraint violation
   - Root Cause: Seed script created users without passwords, and existing sessions had invalid organizationId references
   - Solution: Updated seed script to include proper password hashing for demo users

### Demo Account Details
**Login Credentials:**
- **Admin User**: admin@acme-mfg.com / password123
- **Engineer**: john.engineer@acme-mfg.com / password123  
- **Manager**: sarah.manager@acme-mfg.com / password123

### How to Fix ECR Creation Issue
1. **Log out** of current session (invalid organizationId)
2. **Log in** with one of the demo accounts above
3. **Try creating an ECR** - should work now

### Issues Fixed Today (Continued)
4. **ECR Status Workflow Enhancement**:
   - Added new `CONVERTED` status for ECRs that have been converted to ECOs
   - Updated ECR-to-ECO conversion process to automatically set ECR status to `CONVERTED`
   - Convert page now only shows `APPROVED` ECRs and removes converted ones from the list
   - Enhanced user feedback with success messages and automatic redirection

### ECR Status Workflow
- **APPROVED** → ECR is approved and appears on Convert page
- **CONVERTED** → ECR has been converted to ECO (disappears from Convert page)
- **IMPLEMENTED** → Actual work is complete (tracked via ECO status)

### Ready for Testing
- ✅ ECO kanban board works correctly with proper status mapping
- ✅ ECR creation works with proper authentication  
- ✅ All demo data seeded with working accounts
- ✅ ECR-to-ECO conversion workflow with status tracking
